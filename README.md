Using the Pandas library, load a CSV file and perform basic data analysis tasks, such as
calculating the average of a selected column. Additionally, use Matplotlib to create
visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to analyze the data. Provide
insights and observations based on the analysis and visualizations.
